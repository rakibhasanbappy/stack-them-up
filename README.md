Stack Them Up is an engaging and addictive block stacking game that challenges players to test their dexterity, strategy, and patience. The objective of the game is to stack blocks in a precise and balanced manner to create the tallest tower possible. The game is developed using WebGL and Three.js, two powerful technologies for creating interactive 3D experiences in web browsers. Additionally, we used CannonJS to add physics in our game.
